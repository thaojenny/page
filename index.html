                    <p class="bold-text">
                    Conducted data analysis and charted sales trends, revealing a skewed distribution towards higher-value items. Identified potential growth by emphasizing leveraging promotions 
                    for sales below $1500 and products priced around $29.4. Furthermore, employed relative frequency analysis to confirm that repeat purchases contributed to 60.4% of total sales, showcasing 
                    their significant impact.</p>

                    <p>  From the chart above, Equipment category of the variable repeat purchases has the most observations among other categories. The next four positions belongs to Medicine, Housing, Food, Toys
                    in a decreasing order which had a small distance from each other. Accessory has the lowest number of repeat purchase. As a result, observations are unbalanced across categories of variable repeat
                    purchases. In conclusion, PetMind should focus on products of Equipment which has the highest volumn repeat purchase to boost company's sale. Besides, PetMind also look at other four categories such 
                    as Medicine, Housing, Food, Toys. </p>
                   <p>  PetMind wants to increase sales by selling more everyday products repeatedly, therefore, we should look at how sales distributed first. </p>

                    <p>  Looking at the sales, from the chart above, we can see that most sales were below $1500. The scatter plot showed distribution in between symmetric and skewed to right. Therefore, we check another methods below. </p>
                    <p> <img src="https://github.com/thaojenny/page/blob/main/2.PNG?raw=true" alt="Project 1"> </p>
                    <p>  When looking at the histogram and the statistic calculation above, we can conclude that the distribution of sales is skewed to right, with most of sales below $1500. There are some outliers which indicated over-2000-dollar-sales were negligible. </p> 
                    <p> To give PetMind company better suggestions on boosting sales, we also need to look at price of an item below. </p>
                    <p>  <img src="https://github.com/thaojenny/page/blob/main/image-5.png?raw=true" alt="Project 1"> </p>
                    <p>
                    The price distribution chart above showed us that most of items with average price of around $29.4 were much more preferred than the others.
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, PetMind can give out promotions or policies on below-1500-dollar-sales and can also look at price of the item around $29.4 to boost the company's revenue.
