                    Conducted data analysis and charted sales trends, revealing a skewed distribution towards higher-value items. Identified potential growth by emphasizing leveraging promotions 
                    for sales below $1500 and products priced around $29.4. Furthermore, employed relative frequency analysis to confirm that repeat purchases contributed to 60.4% of total sales, showcasing 
                    their significant impact.
                    From the chart above, Equipment category of the variable repeat purchases has the most observations among other categories. The next four positions belongs to Medicine, Housing, Food, Toys
                    in a decreasing order which had a small distance from each other. Accessory has the lowest number of repeat purchase. As a result, observations are unbalanced across categories of variable repeat
                    purchases. In conclusion, PetMind should focus on products of Equipment which has the highest volumn repeat purchase to boost company's sale. Besides, PetMind also look at other four categories such 
                    as Medicine, Housing, Food, Toys.
